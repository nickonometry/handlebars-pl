                <p>Sliders are ideal components for adjusting settings that reflect intensity levels, such as volume, brightness,
                    or color saturation.<br /> Sliders may have icons on both ends of the bar that reflect the value intensity.
                    Place the smallest value for the slider range on the left and the largest value on the right.</p>

    <h2>Discrete Slider</h2><br />
    <p>The discrete slider thumb snaps to evenly spaced tick marks along the slider rail. Use for objective settings that require
        specific values for the user to make meaningful adjustments. Each tick mark should change the setting to a level
        that’s discernible to the user. The values are predetermined and aren’t user-editable.</p>
